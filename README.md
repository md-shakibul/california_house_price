# California House Price

This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at predicting house prices in California using machine learning techniques. The goal is to not only create a robust model but also to provide an in-depth explanation of the data, the preprocessing steps, the modeling choices, and alternative approaches. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this project offers a practical guide for both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation in Python.

## Overview

The California House Price project aims to predict the median house price using a variety of features available in the dataset. The repository covers the complete data science lifecycle:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the distribution and relationships of the data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Development:** Train several models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to find the best predictive performance.
- **Evaluation and Tuning:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and perform hyperparameter tuning.
- **Deployment Considerations:** Discuss practical steps for deploying the model in a production environment.

## Motivation

California's real estate market is known for its dynamic and diverse nature. Understanding and predicting house prices in this region can help:
- Home buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
- Real estate agents and financial institutions evaluate market trends.
- Researchers and policymakers study economic and demographic impacts on housing.

This project not only addresses the predictive challenge but also provides insights into **why** certain features are important and **how** data-driven decisions can be made using machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:
- **Location:** Geographical data that might include latitude and longitude.
- **House Characteristics:** Number of rooms, house age, square footage, etc.
- **Economic Indicators:** Median income of residents and other economic factors.
- **Environmental Factors:** Proximity to the coast, elevation, and other local features.

The data is split into training and testing sets, ensuring that model evaluation is done on unseen data.
